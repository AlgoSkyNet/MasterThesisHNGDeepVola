function OptionPrice= HestonNandi_Q_vectorized(S_0,X,Sig_,T_,r,w,a,b,g_)
work in progress % Only works in standardized setup, just for efficiency reasons
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% this function calculates the price of Call option based on the riskfree
% transformed GARCH  option pricing formula of Heston and Nandi(2000). 
% Input:
% Stock and Option specs: 
%   S_0     current price of the underlying asset
%   K       strike price 
%   Sig_    starting value of variance
%   T_       time to maturity in days
%   r       daily risk free interest rate
% Model specs:
%   w       omega
%   a       alpha
%   b       beta
%   g_      riskfree gamma
